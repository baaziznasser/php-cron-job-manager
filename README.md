## Installation

To install this library, simply clone the repository and include the `CronJobManager.php` file in your project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/baaziznasser/php-cron-job-manager.git
```

Then include the class in your PHP file:

```php
require_once 'path/to/Cron_job_manager.php';

## Usage

### Initializing the CronJobManager

Start by initializing the `CronJobManager` class. You can optionally provide a path to the crontab file you want to manage.

```php
$cronManager = new CronJobManager('/path/to/your/crontab/tmp/crontab.tmp');
```

### Setting the Active Crontab

You can set a specific crontab file as active. If the path or file does not exist, the method will create them.

```php
$cronManager->setCrontabActive('/path/to/your/crontab/tmp/crontab.tmp');
```

### Adding a Cron Job

To add a new cron job that runs every Sunday at 6:05 AM:

```php
$cronManager->addCronJob('5', '6', '*', '*', '0', '/usr/bin/php /path/to/your/script.php');
```

### Checking if a Cron Job Exists

To check if a specific cron job exists:

```php
if ($cronManager->cronExists('/usr/bin/php /path/to/your/script.php')) {
    echo "Cron job exists!";
} else {
    echo "Cron job does not exist!";
}
```

### Removing a Cron Job

To remove a cron job based on its command:

```php
$cronManager->removeCronJob('/usr/bin/php /path/to/your/script.php');
```

### Emptying the Crontab

To remove all cron jobs from the current crontab:

```php
$cronManager->emptyCrontab();
```

### Removing the Current Crontab

To remove the current crontab from the system and set its path to `null`:

```php
$cronManager->removeCurrentCrontab();
```

## Permissions Required
